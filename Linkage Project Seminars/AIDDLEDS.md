# AI and duplicate detection to leverage external data source

David Beauchemin will discuss how duplicate detection can be used with AI and NLP techniques to extract information from external data sources using text distance metric (e. g. Jaro) and classification algorithm. He will use a case study in insurance to demonstrate the proposed approach.

1. Intro about me (1 slide)
2. What is our problem? (1 slide)
	We want to use external data base for a specific process (1 slide)
3. How can we achieve a solution for that? (1 slide)
	What our solution needs to do? (1 slide)
	Using NLP, ML and AI. (1 slide)
	But first, let's clarify the term here:
		2. What is NLP in brief? (1 slide)
		3. What is AIÂ and ML in that specific case? (1 slide)
4. A use case
	Mon projet. (20 slides)
5. Advantage of doing such an approach? (10 slides)
	There is commercial solutions out there, why not using it?
	It is a complete NLP problem with important data processing step to do
	It touch many NLP aspet
	It is a straighforward classification problem.
	Thus it can pratice and empower a new ML team in a business
